            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions.</h1>
            <h3>What is a “Hackathon”?</h3>
            <p>A hackathon is an event that gathers many people to make software or hardware products from scratch within some constrained time period, generally between 12 and 48 hours. Last year, Cal Hacks gathered roughly 2,000 students, and 50 corporate sponsors for 36 hours. </p>
            <h3>What is the Cal Hacks Director profile?</h3>
            <p>Directors are self starters who can manage responsibility and work well with other people. We think out of the box to make anything happen, are efficient decesion makers, and are excellent firefighters on the weekend of the event.</p>
            <h3>Do I need to have gone to a hackathon to be a director?</h3>
            <p>No, our directors range from hackathon veterans to people that have never been to one in their life.</p>
            <h3>What if I just want to hack or volunteer at the hackathon?</h3>
            <p>Currently we are recruiting for new directors but when the actual event draws closer we will reach out again for applications to hackers and volunteer at the event.</p>
            <h3>What do you do as a director?</h3>
            <p>We do what it takes to make our event happen smoothly and effectively. From securing sponsors to scheduling day-of logistics, to programming our website and designing our outward facing material, all directors work on multiple aspects of organizing the event.</p>
            <h3>What is the time commitment for being a director?</h3>
            <p>The time commitment ramps as the hackathon becomes closer in the Fall and you should be ready to commit a significant amount of time to the event.</p>
            <h3>I’m really excited about this, what can I do to make my application stand out?</h3>
            <p> If possible, come to one of our infosessions and talk to our curernt directors. It becomes a lot easier to make a decision when we have a face to pair with the online application.</p>
